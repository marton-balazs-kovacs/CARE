# CARE

<!-- badges: start -->
<!-- badges: end -->

The goal of CARE is to provide a simple web interface for completing the
Checklist for assessing responsible use of AI in research (CARE) for a
research project. At the end of the project CARE could be filled out
through this Shiny app and a well-formatted report can be generated to
supplement the paper.

The Shiny app is based on the [Transparency
Checklist](https://github.com/BalazsAczel/TransparencyChecklist).

## Installation

You can install the development version of CARE from
[GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

## Example

after the installation.
